Instructions for running the various programs here

keying.py
like keyingAuto, only you have to use checkedRecs.csv, and put 1 next to recipes you still have yet to craft, 0 next to the ones you've finished

keyingAuto.py
this uses rareRates.txt and startPacket.txt to output all the info about rare recipes you still need to craft, including rare resource
counts based on your inventory and already crafted items.
simply copy the first client_action after the static dump (it will have id=2),
paste it into startPacket.txt, and run keyingAuto.py
then, check keyingInfo.csv for the output information. it should open with excel (or whatever spreadsheet reader you have), and it should
know how to handle a csv file.

krownChestSim.py
this simulates opening krown chests over and over, starting with 1M krowns, going after 'target' items. you set the weights for each
target (0 if you don't want it) in relWeights, and it prints average krowns spent per target received.

staticDumpDiffCheck.py
this was the main thrust of this project originally. for it to work, put the latest two static dumps in the main folder, saved as
sd#####.json, and then put the latest two numbers in sdFileNums as the last two entries (or as the only two, either way), then run it.
it outputs any info to the updates folder, with changes.txt for an overview of all the changes, and detailed changes for each section
in their own txt files.
