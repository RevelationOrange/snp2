# snp2
tools for analyzing snp2, starting with the static dump

currently working on: nothing in particular! given two SD files, it will output complete information on all changes between them,
including full output of the new versions of items, including any quests, buildings, and other items the item is used in
the only case unaccounted for in the full items is items unlocked via achievements; due to the way item names are stored here, it'll be
hard to automatically get this kind of info
luckily it's not that big a deal, as it's unlikely a new item will be added that's unlocked through an achievement

could use help with:
  modules- I don't know how footprints are stored, so if someone wants to look at that, that'd be awesome
  anything in sdDoc_mysteries.txt

These are tools to use for analyzing the static dump (for now) <br>
Later, more things might be added, but this is all I'm working on right now
if anyone has an interesting problem, let me know, I'm down to work on it
