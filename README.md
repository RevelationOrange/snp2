# snp2
tools for analyzing snp2, starting with the static dump

currently working on: getInfo cases are done, now I need to find and combine all info for items, since it's a bit scattered

could use help with:
  modules- I don't know how footprints are stored, so if someone wants to look at that, that'd be awesome
  anything in sdDoc_mysteries.txt
<br>
<h2></h2>
These are tools to use for analyzing the static dump (for now) <br>
Later, more things might be added, but this is all I'm working on right now
if anyone has an interesting problem, let me know, I'm down to work on it
