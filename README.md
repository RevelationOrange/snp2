# snp2
tools for analyzing snp2, starting with the static dump

currently working on: getInfo in snp2lib, doing each case for new things

could use help with:
  modules- I don't know how footprints are stored, so if someone wants to look at that, that'd be awesome
  anything in sdDoc_mysteries.txt

<h2></h2>
These are tools to use for analyzing the static dump (for now)
Later, more things might be added, but this is all I'm working on right now
if anyone has an interesting problem, let me know, I'm down to work on it
