'''
this program (currently) will find differences between two static dump files. place the files (which must be .json
files) in the same folder as staticDumpDiffCheck.py (and make sure oldFileName and newFileName are those of the files
you want to check), and it will write the file changes.txt in the same folder, which contains where each difference is
found, and whether something was added, removed, or changed.

# spacer is the delineator between depth levels of the dict, so output shows up with different spacing

'''
this block explains the logic of the recursive function findTheDiffs and how it determines where differences are found
and what type (add, rem, change, or mismatch if types don't agree)
note that any indices given (which is any location that's just a number) may not be accurate since lists get sorted
note that all output is to the file given
cases:
  type mismatch:
    output that a mismatch was found, add the location and items to the difference list
  dict:
    dict1 == dict2: nothing, just return at the end
    else:
      state that a difference was found, output the keys trail
      difference in keys:
        go through keys and output which keys are new and which were removed
      go through each key that exists in both dicts:
        add key to keys trail, case: dict1[key], dict2[key]
  list:
    list1 == list2: nothing, just return at end
    else:
      state that a difference was found, output the keys trail
      if length diff:
        for one list, check 'if in' the other, record added, removed
        for added, append to diffList: keysTrail, 'add', thing
        for removed, append to diffList: keysTrail, 'rem', thing
        check diffList for any 'dummy' entries. if found, set 'changes to true
        if changes: this means the things in addList and remList aren't additions or removals, but each is a change in another
          output the number of things changed, which is the length of remList, since addList includes the dummy
        else:
          if anything is added or removed, output how many (for both lists)
      else: same length but some changes
        if these are lists of dicts:
          append a dummy entry to newThing and send the two lists back into findTheDiffs, so it'll be treated as an add
          or removal
          this functionality was added because otherwise, the dicts would be delved into and possibly hundreds or
          thousands of differences would be found, and every tiny change would be added to diffList, which isn't at all
          practical
          AFTER that, add a dummy key to the keys trail, since something is going to get removed
        else:
          sort both lists to ensure ordering
          go through each thing, for i in the length of the lists:
            add i to keys trail
            case: list1[i], list2[i], i
  else (str, int, empty, whatever):
    if thing1 == thing2: nothing, just return at end
    else:
      output that data was changed and where, state the old and new things
      find the last entry in keysTrail that's not an index
      add keysTrail[-1], 'change', thing1, thing2 to diffList
  del keysTrail[-1]
